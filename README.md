# Weather prediction from stereo images
### Project 2 in INF367A : Topological Deep Learning
**Odin Hoff Gard√•, April 2023**

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 1000 stereo images each consisting of one left and one right image. Each image has 3 channels (RGB) with resolution 879x400 (w x h). The possible label values are 'cloudy' (0) and 'sunny' (1). The dataset is perfectly balanced with 500 samples of each label.

*Figure: Two images (index 2 and 3) from the dataset (left and right view) with labels 'sunny' and 'cloudy'.*

**Note:** The two cameras used were mounted on top of a car, with one in the center and one on the right hand side, 54 cm apart. Still, we will call the center and right images the *left view* and the *right view*, respectively.

## Symmetries

### Dihedral group $D_2$

The symmetry group of a (non-square) rectangle is the dihedral group $D_2$, isomorphic to the Klein four-group $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$. Geometrically, the group $D_2$ can be described by the following symmetries:
- $e$: rotation by 0 (identity),
- $r$: rotation by $\pi$,
- $m_h$: mirroring along the horizontal axis, and
- $m_v$: mirroring along the vertical axis.


|$D_2$|$e$|$r$|$m_h$|$m_v$|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|$e$|$e$|$r$|$m_h$|$m_v$|
|$r$|$r$|$e$|$m_v$|$m_h$|
|$m_h$|$m_h$|$m_v$|$e$|$r$|
|$m_v$|$m_v$|$m_h$|$r$|$e$|

*Table: The Cayley table of $D_2$. The group is generated by the two elements $m_h$ and $m_v$.*

We could let two copies of $D_2$ act on the left and right views independently. In that case, we would have been working with the group $D_2\times D_2\equiv \mathbb{Z}_2^4$ of order $16$. But, as the left and right views are physically coupled in the real-world, we choose to continue with a single copy of $D_2$ acting on our images as shown in the following figure:

*Figure: We have three group elements (in addition to the identity) acting on a stereo image. One rotation shown in red, and two mirror symmetries shown in blue and green around the vertical and horizontal axes, respectively.*
