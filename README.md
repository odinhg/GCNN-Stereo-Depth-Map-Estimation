# Weather prediction from stereo images
### Project 2 in INF367A : Topological Deep Learning
**Odin Hoff Gardå, April 2023**

## Scope of this project 

In this project, we will compare the performance of the following three models:
- A standard off-the-shelf convolutional neural network (**CNN**), 
- a convolutional neural network with smoothing (**SmoothCNN**) and 
- a group equivariant convolutional neural network (**GCNN**).

The learning objective for all models is to predict weather condition (cloudy or sunny) from a stereo image as input. In other words, we are solving a binary regression problem. We report cross entropy loss (also known as log loss) and classification accuracies on the training, validation and test dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 1000 stereo images each consisting of one left and one right image. Each image has 3 channels (RGB) with resolution 879x400 (WxH). The possible label values are 'cloudy' (0) and 'sunny' (1). The dataset is perfectly balanced with 500 samples of each label.

**Figure:** Two images (index 2 and 3) from the dataset (left and right view) with labels 'sunny' and 'cloudy'.

**Note:** The two cameras used were mounted on top of a car, with one in the center and one on the right hand side, 54 cm apart. Still, we will call the center and right images the *left view* and the *right view*, respectively.

## Symmetries

### Dihedral group $D_2$

The symmetry group of a (non-square) rectangle is the dihedral group $D_2$, isomorphic to the Klein four-group $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$. Geometrically, the group $D_2$ can be described by the following symmetries:
- $e$: rotation by 0 (identity),
- $r$: rotation by $\pi$,
- $m_h$: mirroring along the horizontal axis, and
- $m_v$: mirroring along the vertical axis.


|$D_2$|$e$|$r$|$m_h$|$m_v$|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|$e$|$e$|$r$|$m_h$|$m_v$|
|$r$|$r$|$e$|$m_v$|$m_h$|
|$m_h$|$m_h$|$m_v$|$e$|$r$|
|$m_v$|$m_v$|$m_h$|$r$|$e$|

**Table:** The Cayley table of $D_2$. The group is generated by the two elements $m_h$ and $m_v$.

We could let two copies of $D_2$ act on the left and right views independently. In that case, we would have been working with the group $D_2\times D_2\equiv \mathbb{Z}_2^4$ of order $16$. But, as the left and right views are physically coupled in the real-world, we choose to continue with a single copy of $D_2$ acting on our images as shown in the following figure:

**Figure:** We have three non-trivial $D_2$-actions on a stereo image. One rotation shown in red, and two mirror symmetries. The mirror symmetries around the vertical and horizontal axes are shown in blue and green, respectively.

In practice, *both views are combined* by stacking them horizontally, giving us a single image of size 1758x400 (WxH). The $D_2$ group actions are simply implemented using `torch.flip()` and also supports mini-batches.

## Viewing stereo images as signals
We now give a more theoretical perspective on the action of $D_2$ on the stereo images. 

Let $[n]=\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$ and consider the domain $\Omega = [H]\times [W]$. In our case, $H=400$ and $W=1758$. We consider stereo images as 3-dimensional (RGB) signals on $\Omega$. That is, the images are viewed as elements of the vector space $\mathcal{X}(\Omega) = \operatorname{Map}(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^3)$.

### Group action of $D_2$ on $\Omega$
Let $p=(a,b)$ be an element of $\Omega$ and define the group action
$$
\begin{aligned}
D_2\times\Omega&\to\Omega\\
(g, p)&\mapsto g\cdot p
\end{aligned}
$$
on the generators $m_v$ and $m_h$ by letting $m_v\cdot p = (a,W-b)$ and $m_h\cdot p = (H-a, b)$. We then get that $r\cdot p = (H-a,W-b)$ and $e\cdot p = p$ by extending the above map to a group action.

### Lifting the group action to signals
We lift the $D_2$-action on $\Omega$ to a $D_2$-action on $\mathcal{X}(\Omega)$ as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\psi\colon D_2\times\mathcal{X}(\Omega)&\to\mathcal{X}(\Omega)\\
(g,x)&\mapsto \left[g\cdot x\colon p\mapsto x(g^{-1}\cdot p)\right].
\end{aligned}
$$

Since in $D_2$, every element is its own inverse, we simply have that $g\cdot x(p)=x(g\cdot p)$. 

**Note:** The map $D_2\to\operatorname{Aut} \mathcal{X}(\Omega)$ defined by $g\mapsto \psi(g, -)$ is nothing but the (left) regular representation of $D_2$ on the vector space $\mathcal{X}(\Omega)$.
